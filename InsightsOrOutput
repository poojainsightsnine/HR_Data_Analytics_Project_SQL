📊 Key Analytical Insights & Capabilities
This SQL project implements a robust set of queries and database views for comprehensive Human Resources data analysis, covering three main areas:

1. 🧑‍💻 Employee & Organizational Structure Analysis
The queries provide a foundational understanding of the workforce composition and structure:

Organizational Mapping: Successfully established the manager-employee hierarchy and mapped all employees to their respective departments and job roles.

Workforce Demographics: Identified employees based on specific criteria, such as date of joining (e.g., post-2020 hires) and salary thresholds (e.g., above $50,000).

Data Integrity: Identified and located employees with missing or unassigned manager IDs.

2. 💰 Compensation and Salary Trend Analysis
The analysis provides detailed financial insights across the organization:

Departmental Compensation: Calculated total and average salary for every department, revealing high-cost and cost-effective centers.

Job Role Compensation: Determined the average salary for each job role and identified employees whose current salary exceeds the average for their job level.

Salary History: Tracked and structured year-over-year salary trends for individual employees, enabling longitudinal compensation reviews.

3. 📈 Performance and Attrition (Turnover) Metrics
The project delivers crucial metrics for monitoring workforce health and stability:

Attrition Rate Calculation: Computed the department-wise attrition count and percentage, highlighting areas with the highest employee turnover risk.

Performance Benchmarking: Calculated the average performance score (quantified) for each department, allowing for objective comparison and management focus.

Performance Distribution: Provided a count of employees categorized into each performance level (e.g., Excellent, Good), offering a quick view of overall workforce quality.

Latest Scores: Created a mechanism (views) to consistently pull the latest available performance score for every employee.
